#### Arc Flash
[Wikipedia says:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_flash)

> An arc flash is the light and heat produced from an electric arc supplied with sufficient electrical energy to cause substantial damage, harm, fire, or injury. Electrical arcs experience negative resistance, which causes the electrical resistance to decrease as the arc temperature increases.  

In laymans terms; An arc flash is the ginormous spark / flash that happens when something electrical goes wrong (see [Fault]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#fault)). Watch [this](http://goo.gl/KFDkxk) YouTube video for a demonstration.


#### Bonding
[Wikipedia says:](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_bonding)

> Electrical bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting all exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity in a room or building as protection from electric shock.

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A low impedance path obtained by permanently joining all non-current-carrying metal parts to
ensure electrical continuity and having the capacity to conduct safely any current likely to be imposed on it.

All "exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity in a room or building", and in particular the electrical system, are connected together with a bonding [conductor]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#conductor). This [conductor]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#conductor) is often bare copper or has a green sheething and erroneously referred to as the [ground]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#ground). At the electrical [service entrance]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#service-entrance), will be a [ground]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#ground). This [ground]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#ground) is then extended, as a **bond**, to all "exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity".

#### Branch Circuit

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> That portion of the wiring installation between the final overcurrent device protecting the circuit and the outlet(s).

#### Bus Bar

#### Circuit Breaker

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A device designed to open and close a circuit by non-automatic means and to open the circuit automatically on a predetermined overcurrent without damage to itself when properly applied within its ratings.

#### Conductor

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A wire or cable, or other form of metal, installed for the purpose of conveying electric current from one piece of electrical equipment to another or to ground.

#### Conduit

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A raceway of circular cross-section, other than electrical metallic tubing and electrical non-metallic tubing, into which it is intended that conductors be drawn.

#### Current

The electrical version of flow rate. In a water pipe, flow rate is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and in electrical the flow rate is measured in Amperes (Amps, A). At a given pressure, a larger water pipe is able to flow more water, which is also true in electrical; at a given voltage (voltage is electrical pressure), a larger conductor will pass more current. In water this is because of a phenomenon known as pressure drop, in electrical it is known as voltage drop. Because pressure (voltage) is a potential energy, and energy cannot be created or destroyed (see [conservation of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy)), this potential energy is dissipated thermal energy (heat). In a water pipe, typically this not an issue. In a conductor, this thermal dissipation of energy (heat) is the main reason conductors need to be larger for higher currents. Voltage drop is typically a secondary concern and only applicable to long conductor runs.


#### Disconnect

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A device, group of devices, or other means whereby the conductors of a circuit can be disconnected from their source of supply.

#### Distribution Panel

#### EMT

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A raceway of metal having circular cross-section into which it is intended that conductors be drawn and that has a wall thinner than that of rigid metal conduit and an outside diameter sufficiently different from that of rigid conduit to render it impracticable for anyone to thread it with standard pipe thread.

#### Fault

#### Feeder

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

>Any portion of an electrical circuit between the service box or other source of supply and the branch circuit overcurrent devices.

#### Fuse

#### Ground

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> A connection to earth obtained by a grounding electrode.

#### Ground Fault

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> An unintentional electrical path between a part operating normally at some potential to ground, and ground.

#### kVA

#### Motor Starter

#### Neutral

#### Overcurrent Protection

Defined in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (2012) as:

> Any device capable of automatically opening an electric circuit, under both predetermined overload and short-circuit conditions, either by fusing of metal or by electromechanical means.

Overcurrent protection is typically either a [circuit breaker]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#circuit-breaker) or a [fuse]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#fuse). Electrical utilities and some very large facilities will use [protection relays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protective_relay). In layman's terms, an overcurrent device turns off (trips) when too much [current]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#current) flows through it.

Think of a water line entering a bathroom. If you add up the water flow for all the fixtures in the bathroom (sink, toilet, shower) then you know the maximum water flow that should ever be through the water line entering the bathroom. If the water flow ever exceeds that amount, you must have a leak. A device that would turn the water off automatically under this condition would be analogous to an overcurrent protection device.

#### Trip

When a circuit has too much current flowing through it and the overcurrent protection device operates

> The mechanical engineer plugged in too many electric heaters and tripped the circuit breaker.

#### Variable Frequency Drive

#### Voltage

A measure of the electric potential _difference_ between two points.

Voltage is the measurement of electrical pressure. It is analogous to pressure in a water pipe. Water through a faucet will flow at a given rate at a given pressure. If the water pressure were to increase the water would flow at a faster rate through that same faucet (for water flow, see [current]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#circuit-breaker). Faucets require a certain water pressure to operate as intended, just as electrical devices are designed to operate at a certain electrical pressure (voltage). The similarities continue with water pipes and electrical conductors. A water pipe will be designed with a maximum pressure rating, but is equally capable of carrying any pressure less than the maximum, as an electrical conductor is designed with a maximum voltage rating, but is equally capable of carrying any voltage less than the maximum.
