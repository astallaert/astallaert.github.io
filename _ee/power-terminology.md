#### Arc Flash
[Wikipedia says:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_flash)

> An arc flash is the light and heat produced from an electric arc supplied with sufficient electrical energy to cause substantial damage, harm, fire, or injury. Electrical arcs experience negative resistance, which causes the electrical resistance to decrease as the arc temperature increases.  

In laymans terms; An arc flash is the ginormous spark / flash that happens when something electrical goes wrong (see [Fault]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#fault)). Watch [this](http://goo.gl/KFDkxk) YouTube video for a demonstration.


#### Bonding
[Wikipedia says:](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_bonding)

> Electrical bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting all exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity in a room or building as protection from electric shock.

All "exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity in a room or building", and in particular the electrical system, are connected together with a bonding conductor. This conductor is often bare copper or has a green sheething and erroneously referred to as the [ground]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#ground). At the electrical service entrance, will be a [ground]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#ground). This [ground]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#ground) is then extended, as a **bond**, to all "exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity".

The reason we bond all metals is to ensure that they all have the same [voltage]({{ site.baseurl }}/ee/power-terminology/#voltage). Where electricity comes into the building, the metal parts are electrically connected to ground, which ensures that all metal parts have a voltage of 0V (because they are all connected together).
